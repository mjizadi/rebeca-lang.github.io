#### Overview
**ReUML Designer** is developed for UML modelers and Rebeca developers. It lets UML modelers verify their models without being concerned about details of Rebeca, and it allows Rebeca developers to model their systems with UML and use automatic code generation.

The tool has been developed using Java language, so it is portable and can be run on any platform that has a Java Runtime Environment.

The current version of this tool supports the following features in Rebeca model:

* Reactive Classes
* Main (system description)
* Known objects
* Message Servers
* State Variables
* Parameter passing in Message Servers
* Non-deterministic choice
* Asynchronous messages between Rebecs
* Synchronous messages between Rebeca model and external systems
* Per rebec queue length
