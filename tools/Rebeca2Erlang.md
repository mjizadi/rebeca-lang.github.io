#### Overview
With the the popularity of web services and applications in wireless networks, distributed computing is becoming ubiquitous. The software can be time critical and as such must respond to requests in a timely fashion.
Analyzing timing behaviour of distributed and asynchronous systems is a particularly challenging task. We present an extension of the actor-based Rebeca language that can be used to model distributed and asynchronous systems with timing constraints. We provide an automated translation
from Timed Rebeca to Erlang. Translation schemes for both reÃ«ned programs and simulation are included. Thee translation tool is built upon formal mapping from Timed Rebeca to Erlang and the Structural Operational Semantics of Timed Rebeca. A few examples are studied and experimental results are provided.
