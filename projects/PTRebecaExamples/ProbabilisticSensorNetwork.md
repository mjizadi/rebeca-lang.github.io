#### Problem Description

In sensor network model, there are two sensors in the environment which are measuring the toxic level of the environment. The measured information is sent periodically by sensor to the admin. If the toxic level reported by sensors reaches to a predefined dangerous level, the admin sends a message to the scientist, who is working in the environment, to leave work and go to a safe place. The admin waits for a couple of times for the acknowledgement from scientist. If the acknowledgement is not received on time, admin asks the rescue team to reach the scientist and save him. The rescue team maybe encounters obstacles during the mission, which increases the rescue time, and causes the failure of mission.
